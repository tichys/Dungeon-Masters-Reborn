(<b>17:56:16</b>) Cowdogs Reported: A storage like that for sleeping bags and equipment/armor/tools would be good too, and so would a equip all armor and a equip -weapon type- option in a units interact menu would be good too and so would making them not dissappear after death.... This would make it so we could raise massive armys..both of the storages and commands...5+ units at a time could get full equipment and fully suit up ready for combat at once...and have food  thanks to my previous food storage suggestion.<br>

(<b>15:07:02</b>) TheNiccer Reported: Some suggestions by TheNiccer.

Gods:
-Player sacrifice messages should show the amount of worship points given.
eg. &#34;Video Atronach has made a sacrifice to you. (+25 worship)&#34;.

-Gods could have the following abilities. Evil: Draw in aggressisve attention from all hostile NPCs within X distance from the target unit. Good: scare hostile NPC attention from target unit temporarily.

-The ability to temporarily take over a unit on an altar - perhaps talking through them, in addition to EvilSpeech. This could give possibilities for RP.

-A &#34;pray&#34; verb for altars? Slowly regenerating worship points over time, similar to fishing and sleeping.

-A neutral, weaker god race. Maybe a spirit? Ability to take over units, like poltergeist.<br>

(<b>22:08:09</b>) Blue of Silvers Reported: spider vamps... they&#39;re the glich. Hunter vamps... they&#39;re the issue. Equipment with hunter vamps is the bigger issue... the cause of these issues.... a glich... the glich? Turning to mist and back. Simply said, a spider can be infected, they can&#39;t equip anything now, but at level 20 they can turn to mist and back, and equip things... Warrior spiders, this ain&#39;t a big deal, as they arn&#39;t that great to begin with... but..... Hunter spiders... the speed is carried over. The rate of training is carried over. This allows the creation of the most powerful unit on the server. Hunter speed with maxxed out power and a hell forged sword is a little Over powered, only thing hunter vampires CAN&#39;T do, is dig or cut trees. For this matter there are 5 options &#39;Leave it be&#39; &#39;Make Spidy Vamps Impossible&#39; or the more complicated approtch.. &#39;Make the Hunter Speed not carry over into vamps&#39; there&#39;s also the option of just curing the turning to mist and back, and making it so it auto-equips everything you had on before, as to stop the ability to Equip anything... a FINNAL and probably my favorite option, would be to make spider vampires a unique race overall. Making them have unique Icons, and unique combat capabilities and maintaining their ability to use webbing. Anyway, I discovered this glich way back, I hope you can find the time to put effort into the finnal option, as it would be the best option for the server overall. Keep in mind, leaving it the way it is... only a few people know this, and even fewer use it. But.... if you did leave it be, those people would have overpowered units whenever they can get a vampire.<br>
(<b>22:14:33</b>) Blue of Silvers Reported: Two other minor and un-effecting gliches that are related to vampires are.. 

A: Morphing while flying will give you the animation of the unit type selected on the ground.

B: Morphing into a demon on the ground will give you demon wings, not sure if this is at all situation based, but when you fly in demon form, you randomly gain a second set of vampire wings flapping behind the un-moving demon wings

Hope this can come in useful and be fixxed!<br>
(<b>06:24:22</b>) Jhester Reported: kobolds can&#39;t make campfires but have the option<br>
(<b>04:50:56</b>) Blue of Silvers Reported: Seems there&#39;s an error with goblins and wood floors, in the middle of making a nice house, and oh wait, I seem incapable of building wood floors. I&#39;d presume it&#39;s simply a typo in the material required, as it still says &#34;Click and drag to place floor&#34; when you select it, but for some reason you can&#39;t build anything. Probably won&#39;t take much work to fix, but it is somthing you need to do eventually.<br>
(<b>04:53:29</b>) Blue of Silvers Reported: You&#39;re probably been told this many times before, and probably know of it already, but the &#34;BindUnbindCamera&#34; verb simply, doesn&#39;t seem to work.<br>
(<b>05:16:57</b>) Blue of Silvers Reported: I know, 3 bug posts look like spam, but this is more what a friend was talking about. By the fact that there was no message about weakening spiders at all, I&#39;m under the impression that it&#39;s a bug, but anyway, It seems that spiders are somehow not causing poison damage anymore or somthing, and I&#39;m under the impression it might have somthing to do with having them imune to vampire bites. By how I&#39;m guessing your coding for this is layed out, I&#39;m going to presume the poison damage is somehow being canceled out by their own poison imunity to &#39;poisons&#39; which I presume is the variable you&#39;re using for vampire imunity after labling it a poison. Anyway, it&#39;s causing spiders to be generally useless, or at least this is what a friend was explaining to me, actually havn&#39;t had the time to try for myself, sorry about the... spam?<br>
(<b>05:30:11</b>) Jhester Reported: when your AM(adventure mode) unit enters a hell portal it unbinds your camera<br>
(<b>10:57:52</b>) Hypersama Reported: Well, I don&#39;t know if this is intentional or not, but Warrior spiders, and probably several other kinds of units, can plant tomato seeds. However, when they plant them, they won&#39;t grow.<br>
(<b>12:41:07</b>) Hypersama Reported: If a unit dies while your camera is bound, it kills your materialized form, and makes you restart.<br>
(<b>17:35:31</b>) Hypersama Reported: When automatically eatting grapes due to hunger, grape seeds to not drop. Grapes can be planted directly in the grass.<br>
(<b>05:32:44</b>) Blue of Silver Reported: This... is not a bug report, it&#39;s simply me saying somthing because I don&#39;t know where else to Put it. &#39;An Inmate&#39; is threatening me with a ban for: Durring a Server Status was RP.  After being flooded (seemingly purposefully) by a person I was living with, another friend I was with made a sort of &#39;why the heck did you do that&#39; kind of comment. While I will say flooding a desert is also strongly against RP as it is. The person who flooded the place then responded with &#34;Wow Lol&#34; &#34;Because a flood messed up you&#39;re gonna be a whiny little bitch&#34; I admit I shouldn&#39;t of gone out and killed him, but I really don&#39;t like it when somone messes up and then insults us for being slightly annoyed by somthing they did. As we were all demons other then the person flooding, I feel it was more then reasonable to kill the flooder. How are you meant to respond IC for a desert flooding anyway? An Inmate made a huge deal about me not RPing killing him, but let the flooder off without anything being said against him. So he sheeps my demon, I&#39;m alright with that. It&#39;s true I shouldn&#39;t have killed the spider who flooded me without an RP reason. Even though It seemed stupid for me to be in trouble for it. Anyway, I eventually found out the sheeping had failed however how, it was apperently a permanent  sheeping anyway, It wasn&#39;t working and I was just an invisable unit of what I was before. So I tell an Inmate this, he deletes the creature okay. But when he then starts bringing up how he&#39;s going to ban me and how he now hates me suddenly I&#39;m starting to think this isn&#39;t a fair situation. Personally I don&#39;t care too much if I do get banned. I anticipate that by the time this message gets to you sccral I&#39;ll end up being banned. Even if you do get it, you might ban me for posting this in the bug reports. Anyway, if you don&#39;t belive this, JP2392 and UnicornDustSniffer were there at the time, both were living with the 4 of us, and all of us other then the flooder were half demons. I&#39;m sure you can check the logs also. I don&#39;t care to get the flooder in trouble, as is the reason I havn&#39;t said his name, even though you can check the logs to find it. My point is that I feel some of your admins arn&#39;t exactly the greatest choices. And no I&#39;m not trying to get admin. Also I&#39;m not saying that &#39;an Inmate&#39; isn&#39;t an alright guy, he&#39;s actually a pretty cool guy looking at what he&#39;s talking about. I&#39;m saying he just isn&#39;t fit to have powers if he can&#39;t make any work to be a fair admin who, when he banns people for reacting to another person&#39;s idiocy without RP. Finnally, I&#39;d just like to say sorry for posting this in the bugs section. I hope you do get this message, and I do hope you will make a change of some kind, or at least tell him to put a little more effort into payying attention. I do enjoy your server, I have gained a disliking to &#39;An Inmate&#39; but really that doen&#39;t effect this at all. I&#39;m not aiming to look 100% in the right, even though I feel I am, but I probably deserve to be punished in some way I don&#39;t know, but just the way Inmate looked souly towards me in the matter and didn&#39;t even say anything to anyone else, he instantly took sides.. I feel it&#39;s just wrong. Anyway, I&#39;m just ranting now, so anyway, happy new years! And good luck on the future of your awsome server. And to make a small note related to this even being a bug report: The Fact that you can even flood deserts and such is sorta... bad. Ditch digging maybe, but I&#39;d suggest making it so there are diffrent types of water: Floodable water which can be placed in caves and such for a enclosed water effect, and flooded water, for placing on the open map and also the result of a flood that cannot be flooded by destroying a wall next to it. Just saying because the fact that there are times that people just flood the desert is... stupid. Oh, and sorry this is so long, I rant alot. so Gday to you.<br>
(<b>06:11:08</b>) UnicornDustSniffer Reported: <br>
(<b>19:29:26</b>) Blue of Silver Reported: Minor Bug with spiders, really minor. If you press i a multiple ammount of times to get more then 1 window going, you can go &#34;Interact&gt;This Creature&gt;Lay Egg&gt;Warrior Spider&#34; or whatever, at the point you get to &#39;lay egg&#39; usually it would stop you if you don&#39;t have enough web, but it doesn&#39;t cost you web until you get to selecting what unit you wish to create. Generally the glich leads to you being able to lay as many eggs as you want bringing you into negative silk values. Really, uneffecting but it is a glich.<br>

Soul eater blade when eating level 100 corpses player/unowned always gives 1 max damage while 1.25 min damage so after about 7 level 100 char kills or equally you will be getting a better minimum damage then you would a max damageSo after a considerable few kills you&#39;ll always be doing more minimum damage then max

(<b>21:11:50</b>) UnicornDustSniffer Reported: Hmm, i&#39;m sure this is just a hiccup in the server but never the less. My brother Brennan, and his account Dont Mass With Me, had a rare gargoyle at the start of the server. After this server hiccup he also got ANOTHER rare which is Evil God, and Good God. Not sure if this is a bug or just a glitch.

(<b>15:36:28</b>) Decius Reln Reported: Hmm. Actually, I would like to make a suggestion. I do not yet remember where I would put them, so I decided upon here if it would not be a bother. The addition of a random tree generator. Upon looking at it largely on &#34;TheLionsRoar&#39;s&#34; Server, I have decided that if made much more sparsely, it would lead to the game being funner and better for all. Thank you for reading this and considering, and I hope it will be so.<br>

(<b>17:06:56</b>) Blue of Silvers Reported: Looking at the update stopping you from giving away your starting units.. shouldn&#39;t this go for spider queens too?<br>

(<b>18:13:04</b>) Crysh Reported: Minor note, it seems that the north exit of the hell place is generally quite lacking in demons. The south is much more populated. I&#39;d suggest adding a few more to the north exit so that it&#39;s not as safe.<br>
(<b>20:14:14</b>) Kylelopezwms Reported: sugestion- Gargoyle should start in cave

(<b>19:15:47</b>) Crysh Reported: Well, I&#39;ve got a random suggestion, Mineing and Wood Cutting Skill seem a tad useless.. perhapse you&#39;d think of making it so maybe having skill in them is less effective on the rate of digging or cutting, and more focused on the matterail you get. For Mining it would be good on chance of getting gems, and rate of getting the rare metal for dwarfs. For Wood Cutting, it could maybe add the ammount of wood you get per tree every 500 levels or something. Just a thought while I looked at them and thought how boring fast digging and cutting is.<br>

<br>
(<b>21:04:09</b>) Crysh Reported: More a suggestion then a bug, but.. working with seeds can be a pain. It&#39;d be nice to maybe have A: A verb to pick up all nearby seeds, and B: to be able to simply double click on a seed to plant it rather then having to go through a menu to plant it.<br>
(<b>22:57:13</b>) JayCei1213 Reported: Sometimes, human characters come up as npcs <br>

(<b>02:33:07</b>) Crysh Reported: wagons can&#39;t keep up with goblin speed and can get annoying when traveling large distances.<br>
(<b>03:23:02</b>) Crysh Reported: Now... I am pissed. Astral Book.... DON&#39;T LET PEOPLE HAVE IT! I mean... I&#39;ve got people like DarkKuta, JayCei, and others randomly using it to locate me, then randomly coming by to kill me. The fact that they do it, without any IC or OOC reason pisses me off. I mean, I put like 3 good hours into training my unit&#39;s crafting skills before I start going heavy on combat skills.. and then it&#39;s put to waste by some people who just kill me for fun.. even if I lived in a cave they&#39;d still be able to reach me. It really gets annoying that there&#39;s even an ability to track down other players and reach them instantly. I can&#39;t stand a chance in a fight because the other force happens to have an army of OP rare races, and all I got are whatever normal race I decide to be. I really do hope you can just remove any and all things related to being able to find people and kill them like this. Those powers should be limited to Admins alone or things like what&#39;s happening right now will happen. Over OOC I&#39;m hearing I&#39;m not the only one that was being killed randomly like this.<br>
(<b>03:40:32</b>) Tumuko Reported: After being infected by a Vampire while I was offline when I came back online none of my units would sleep<br>

(<b>19:56:19</b>) OwlsHavingSex Reported: Scratch that;; Zombie Drake&#39;s breath makes the infected unit become -not- a zombie, named a zombie, and not under anyone&#39;s control. Sweet.<br>
(<b>00:04:38</b>) Crysh Reported: Although I feel this is probably perfectly reasonable: You can&#39;t burn people directly with pyro powers.<br>
(<b>00:17:52</b>) Crysh Reported: Bug 2 for Ilithids, telekinesis effects themselves. Can get annoying when you&#39;re banging someone into a tree.<br>
(<b>10:00:16</b>) OwlsHavingSex Reported: For Spiders;;
If you train your unit and your poison damage reaches say 24, as soon as your poison gland comes in, it lowers it back down to like 15 or whatever it would be.

(<b>11:15:47</b>) Crysh Reported: Report 3 on Illithids: They seem to collect WAY too many gems compaired to other races, I&#39;ve dug out a 5x5 area, and got about 10 gems.<br>

Second thing:when u are delimbed and turn to werewolf form u can walk again and equip leggings again and you have your icon with arms etc but u still can&#39;t use the arms 
Third thing: demons get heat by desert is that normal? they can resist hell heat but not desert?<br>
(<b>15:13:00</b>) Crysh Reported: Traps being able to be activated on flying units is a big one enough glich I&#39;d say to report. Mind you, flying units with bows is pretty OP. Anyway, as a report for Illithids, they are a perfectly good race, I notice they get 4 wood per tree if that&#39;s a mistake or meant to be. Something you might want to look into is if they&#39;re able to be half demons or not and all those other infections. I&#39;m thinking they should be treated in most cases as an average unit. Their power seems generally average afterall. Anyway, I feel that they&#39;re a race that&#39;s not even too powerful, but amazingly fun to play. They could do with some building ability though. Overall, amazingly good race. I&#39;d play em all the time if I could.<br>
(<b>15:37:45</b>) Jhester Reported: when a dragon equipped werewolf ring it changes into a werewolf with that i mean it can&#39;t change type it can&#39;t lay eggs etc it becomes invisible and will just use claw skill<br>

After I was done training on the post to use the brainmasher I equiped it, and then I put him over to the side so hes not in my way of things and a moment later he said he was hungry then he ate the cave fish meat and died, and hes a lizard, kinda sucked but o well.

(<b>16:27:15</b>) JayCei1213 Reported: I believe that due to the event that occured and the use of the demon book, the ammount of demons that were spawning in one location were crashing the server, not only that, but the forcefileds were crashing it too, as they already had such a risk,

(<b>16:33:13</b>) Homedo Reported: Homedo destroys the shield of holy light covering {Homedo} Possessed One!

(<b>22:20:22</b>) XXRentenXX Reported: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Nerd <br>
(<b>22:21:39</b>) XXRentenXX Reported: HAHAHAHAHAHA you are a ner who spends all his time playing a rpg computer game no one cares about<br>
(<b>17:54:43</b>) Crysh Reported: In the case of werewolf orcs, at level 40 when they gain the beserker or defencive abilities and also the ability to change from werewolf at will. There seems to be a conflict where it gives you the orc ability for fight modes, and not the werewolf switch. This might be fine, but the fact that it stops transformation means you could level to level 40 while not in werewolf mode and then you fully lose access to werewolf abilities.<br>
(<b>22:38:27</b>) DarkButler Reported: There is a bug that when you are infected by a devourer or zombie and you are about to turn if you suicide your unit it will rise as a zombie for yourself in 0,0,0 and by pressing &#39;z&#39; the unit spawns at the devourer and when you move it it reappears as your own unit.<br>

Must Wait before speaking again!
Whenever I try to talk Even if its several minutes apart.
I have tried hitting G and teleporting to an XYZ coord but that doesnt work.
thanks for your time.<br>
(<b>01:44:54</b>) Zomadan Reported: Not a bug though, is that the detect locate thing that the Astral book has is OP and that it can be spammed over and over again, takeing from you the only protection, and thats hideing....

If its not going to removed for I don&#39;t know what reason At least add some damages from useing it like a risk, like maby a 20% chance of nocking off a range layer that you can see like all the way around and smaller and smaller, since I don&#39;t think killing the user or anything like that is in anyway of loss...

With no way to hide or restart, then there is no use in continueing playing if your just going to be teleported to the moment you start and dieing...<br>
(<b>18:12:28</b>) Crysh Reported: To prevent people hiding who killed who on the logs, I&#39;d suggest for units such as the sand king&#39;s normal unit spawns and Illithids, to have their owner&#39;s name placed at the begining of the name rather then a unit being named just &#34;Illithid&#34; rather then having the user name before Illithid. like on most units. Pain in the but when you get blamed for something the logs can&#39;t prove you didn&#39;t do.<br>
(<b>20:45:39</b>) Mrdeathofhel Reported: it wont let me breed with my queen with a warrior spider<br>
(<b>21:21:29</b>) Crysh Reported: Personally I think something needs to be changed about the astral book. They can use it to find your exact location, teleport directly to your alter and destroy it before you can do anything. It&#39;s really sad when you make your elder brain and you&#39;re instantly teleported to and lose the rare, or when you&#39;re a god and you finnally possess a unit when suddenly you get located and teleported to while they kill this weak level 1 unit you just possessed and destroy your alter. The existance of this book is giving clans far too much of an admin-like power over the server. I greatly suggest you weaken if not remove the astral book as well as well as adding a few limitations to teleportation abilities.<br>
(<b>14:57:04</b>) Crysh Reported: Sand kings can&#39;t make gremlins. Quite simply I think this should be added now that gremlins are a playable normal race.<br>
(<b>20:41:23</b>) Karapanter Reported: <br>
(<b>12:58:01</b>) Paranoid454 Reported: hi<br>
(<b>11:04:06</b>) The Winged Divine Dragon of Ra Reported: Pulling wagon&#39;s then entering a astral portal bugs units to constantly pulling the wagon and won&#39;t sleep unless they stop pulling another wagon nearby two possible fixes make pulled wagons go through portal too or auto stop pulling wagon at portal location.<br>
(<b>16:45:26</b>) The Winged Divine Dragon of Ra Reported: Equip dual gladius with shield in inventory, click the equip all armor button. 
Sheild dual gladius equipped at once xD<br>
(<b>19:56:09</b>) Crysh Reported: Skeletons can&#39;t patrol due to not having eyes naturally, the message: &#34;You&#39;re missing eyes!&#34; comes up.<br>
